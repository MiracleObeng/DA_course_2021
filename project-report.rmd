# Decision
Would German apple farmers include chicken into their apple plantation in order to deal with the programmed banning of certain agro chemicals especially herbicides in the coming years?

# Introduction
Chicken in apple plantation is an agroforestry practice. This system is also known as the Silvopoutry system (integration of poultry with crops and/or trees production) has been identified as a sustainable way to increase the productivity of land and to provide a number of ecosystem services and environmental benefits compared to disaggregated agricultural and woodland systems. Organic and free-range poultry have, besides having access to a hen house, access to an outdoor run. In this respect, it is well known that poultry are more inclined to use the range when it is enriched with trees, and that in turn feather picking is reduced when more hens use the range.


## Benefits of the System
Chicken welfare (reduced stress, reduce pecking)

Valuable revenue stream (commercial fruit)

More tree cover result fewer water birds coming to the farm and hence lower the rate of transmit avian influenza virus transmission

The trees can provide shade for chicken in summer, and shelter from wind in the winter

The poultry can promote nutrient cycling, reduce scab and pest/weed control

Reduce point load of nutrients because hens spread over a larger surface

## Challenges and uncertatinties of the system
Gradual decrease of chicken benefits with distance to coop

Few studies on disease and pest reduction resulting in (and unclear observations) estimations of inputs

Reducing occurrence of insect, disease and pest does not linearly translate to decrease in controlling these.

# Stakeholders
Our stakeholders are the people who will directly or indirectly benefit form the decision model. They Include;Farmers (apple and chicken), Retailers, Consumers, Non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

## Decision Maker
Farmers with already established, conventional commercial apple farmer in NW Europe. Farmers are key decision makers because of calculation the Net Present Value (NPV) in the model This is a variable which is more important to the producers (farmer).

# Conceptual and Coded Model

The conceptual model of the decision to inlcude chicken into the apple orchard consists out of two main parts (refer to picture). The first covers the direct costs and benefits of the to be included chicken. Costs consist out of the investment costs and the running costs. Under investment costs falls mainly the infrastructure necessary to keep the chicken which are a mobile chicken house and fencing. Running costs are the recurring cost items of keeping chicken. These are namely the egg-laying hens bought, fodder and bedding, costs of the veterinarian, energy and water, maintenance cost of the housing, costs associated to market the chicken products (like finding a seller for the chicken produce), costs of the animal insurance and additional labour costs. These cost items were expressed on basis per chicken kept, so that they are scaleable. Furthermore, we included the risk of avian influenca which can either occure in the neighbourhood of the establishment or within the chicken flock. IN either way it mainly increases the running costs, as there are certain protocols and procedures to follow in these cases, like keeping the chicken indoor  the  Direct benefits of the chicken include the laid eggs throughout the year and the 'old' chicken at the end of the year sold for meat. These are modified by the prices for the produce, the period length of egg-laying and the egg-output per chicken. Furthermore the share of marketable eggs and the 'survival' rate of the chicken affect the benefits. The total direct revenue of keeping chicken in the orchard are calculated by subtracting the costs from the benefits. 

The other component of the model consits out of the apple orchard. In our project we decided to include all aspects of the apple orchard even if not amended by the presence of chicken. So similar to the chicken part, it consists out of the costs and benefits of growing apple, with the difference that the orchard is already established and thus there are no initial investments. Benefits come mainly from the apple harvested and sold, which are modified by the apple price and yield. Costs were differentiated between items affected by the chicken and chicken-independent ones.
